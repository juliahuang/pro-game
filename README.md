**The game:**

The deck consists of 63 cards, each distinct and containing up to six dots (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple). At any given point in the game, seven of the cards are shown, and the player must find a set of cards such that for each color, there is an even number of dots. For example, a set of cards [Red, Orange, Green], [Red, Orange, Blue] and [Green, Blue] would satisfy this condition. The set is removed and the deck is dealt to fill in the three empty spaces so that seven cards are showing.

**Modes:**
- Speed -- race against time to go through the deck! Try to place in the top 10!
- Multiplayer -- race against your friends to collect the most cards!

**How to play:**

When you have found a set, you can click on the given cards, and press the button to verify that it is a set; or use the keys WE ASD ZX (matching their corresponding cards) and press enter to select a set. In the multiplayer game, be sure to press your number / click your slot before verifying the set to make sure the points go to the right person.
